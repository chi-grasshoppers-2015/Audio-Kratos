###About
Audio-Kratos was the culmination of 8 days of work, exploring new technologies of the following:
- S3 Amazon API for content delivery and storage
- Web Audio API to extract audio frequencies for visualization on canvas through javascript
- ID3 tagging to strip metadata from an uploaded song
- Node.js and socket.io for an active websockets server to handle ajax requests, simulating real-time updating

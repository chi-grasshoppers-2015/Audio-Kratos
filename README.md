The highest voted song plays next and the votes reset for the next voting cycle:



###About
Audio-Kratos was the culmination of 8 days of work in exploring the technologies behind music-streaming, storage, and interaction. The main novel feature of Audio-Kratos is the ability for guests to vote on songs they feel should play next, updating the playlist in real-time for all clients connected.

In our work we explored the following:
- S3 Amazon API for content delivery and storage
- Web Audio API to extract audio frequencies for visualization on canvas through javascript
- ID3 tagging to strip metadata from an uploaded song
- Node.js and socket.io for an active websockets server to simulate real-time updating through ajax calls
